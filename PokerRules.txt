Welcome to our version of Texas Hold'Em Poker.

This version of Poker has been edited and streamlined from the original Texas Hold'Em game.


Rules:

         
-Each player is dealt two cards face down, called ‘hole cards’.

-Each round of betting the user can check, call, raise, or fold.

-If you don’t like your hand, you can fold, relinquishing your cards and taking no further part in the hand.

-Any money that you have already contributed in the pot is lost.

-A call involves matching the amount already bet to see the next card (or showdown if the last card was the river card). 

-If you like your hand, you can raise, forcing the original bettor to match your raise if you wants to continue the hand. 

-You may check only if no one else in the round has placed a bet.

-Three cards are placed down (“the flop”), then a fourth card (“the turn”), and, finally, the fifth card (“the river”). 

-The winner of the round is the person with the highest ranking hand during the showdown (after the bets following the river).

Good luck!
